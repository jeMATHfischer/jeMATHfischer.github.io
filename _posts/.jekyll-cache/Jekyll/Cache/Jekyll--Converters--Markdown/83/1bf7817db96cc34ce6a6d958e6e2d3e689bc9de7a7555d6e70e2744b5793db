I"<p>In the previous post, I described the dynamics of our network in terms of agents and their individual opinions. Furthermore, I motivated the mathematical approach in terms of graphs and demonstrated via a simulation the segregation of the network. This post serves as a bridge to extend our discussion of segregation of networks further. To that end, I introduce the mathematical framework with all necessary notation. After having set this groundwork, we can easily extend the model, so bear with me.</p>

<p>At the end of the previous post, we obtrained this visualization of the segregation behaviour.</p>

<p>But how can we frame this behaviour mathematically? My approach of choice is to view the network as a graph with vertices colored with two different colors and define a suitable evolution on it. The central part are edges between vertices of different colors. I call these edges “bichromatic”.</p>

<p>The process \((G_t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}\), which represents the evolving network in form of colored graphs \(G=(V,E)\), is defined by a erasing-and-rewiring procedure of the edges. Each time step of the discrete time process is subdivided into the following steps.
\((G_t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}=((V,E_t))_{t\in \mathbb{N}}\) begins at time \(t=0\) with the initial graph \(G_0=G\). We set \(G_t^c= G_c\backslash G_t\), i.e., the graph resulting when removing from the complete graph \(G_c\) with vertex set \(V\) all edges from \(G_t\). Denote by \(E_t^c\) the set of edges of \(G_t^c\). Additionally, for any vertex \(i\in V\) its color is written as \(c_i\in\{-1,1\}\).</p>

<p>We define the following transition between graphs in terms of the edges denoted by \(E_t\).
At each time step \(t\geq 1\), assuming that \(G_{t-1}\) is a simple graph, we draw uniformly a random edge \((I,J)\in E_{t-1}\). We then draw without replacement edges from \(E_t^c\cup\{(I,J)\}\) until we draw one, which we call \(e^{\ast}\), that has either \(I\) or \(J\) as endpoint. Note that this “or” is not exclusive. The endpoints of \(e^{\ast}\) have the names \(e^{\ast}_1\) and \(e^{\ast}_2\). From this point on I assume for reasons of readability that \(e^{\ast}\) and \((I,J)\) share the end node \(I=e^{\ast}_2\).</p>

<p>If \(|c_I - c_J|\geq |c_I - c_{e^{\ast}_1}|\), we remove the edge \((I,J)\) with probability \(p&gt;0\) from \(E_t\) and add the edge \(e^{\ast}\) to \(E_t\). Thus,
\(E_{t+1} = (E_t\cup\{e^{\ast}\})\backslash\{(I,J)\}\)</p>

<h1 id="remarks-to-take-away">Remarks to take away</h1>

<p>There are some remarks to be made, to take away the essence of this evolution process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The vertex set \(V\) stays the same throughout the process. No vertices are removed or added.</li>
  <li>When starting with a graph \(G_0\) that allows at most one edge between two vertices, this property is preserved for all times.</li>
  <li>The probability \(p\) to remove edges plays an important role in the speed of the segregation.</li>
  <li>Once an edge between two identically colored vertices of color \(c\) exists, it can only be replaced by an edge between two vertices of color \(c\).</li>
  <li>The number of bichromatic edges is (because of the previous point) almost surely non-increasing.</li>
</ul>

<p>When going through the definition of the evolution process, one may realize a pecularity regarding our current restrictions to two colors. When do the colors play a role? Is the number of different colors important? Why should they be discrete?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions will be the topics of the upcoming posts, so stay tuned!</p>
