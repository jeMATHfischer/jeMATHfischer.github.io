<p>When discussing long-term decisions on a global scale, the comparison of different states of populations seems inevitable. Derek Parfit discusses the quality of life relative to the population growth and the implications of overpopulation in his book ‚ÄúReasons and Persons‚Äù laying ground for <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/#AccImpSatPopEth">population ethics</a>. Totalism and Averagism try to access the value of a population, based on the individual well being level. Unfortunately, they are faced with serious objections questioning their validity, amongst which the Repugnant Conclusion and the Sadistic Conclusion, see, e.g., Greaves, ‚ÄúPopulation Axiology‚Äù (2017). With a slight appeal to intuition it is possible to reject both Totalism and Averagism on the grounds of the Repugnant Conclusion and the Sadistic Conclusion.</p>

<p>I think that the previously touched appeals to intuition are in themselves pointless. The populations, to which one seeks to apply Totalism or Averagism, are by construction counterintuitive. They allow to remove and add individuals without taking into account how they fit in the population. I think, that concepts relying on this construction without taking into account that individuals might be <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/4/18285986/robot-animal-nature-expanding-moral-circle-peter-singer"> close </a> to others, contradict our intuition as social beings.</p>

<p>Within this series I am going to develop my idea of Population Ethics for Structured Populations. The (planned) outline looks as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Review of Population Ethics and Defintions</li>
  <li>Population Ethics for Structured Populations (SESP)
    <ul>
      <li>Graphs and Trees to descibe Populations over Time</li>
      <li>Accessing Well-Being in a Structured Population</li>
      <li>Comparing Structured Populations‚Äô Well-Being Levels</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Objections to SESP
    <ul>
      <li>To be developped and looking for input!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While I do my best to lay out all my assumptions as clear as possible and to define all special terms, which I need to base my arguments on, it might happen, that I let one slip. Just make me aware of it and I make it clearer. If you think that my argument(s) are unsound, I ask you to call me out on it, of course supported by sufficiently clear point. 
I am looking forward to developping the idea over the next weeks and hope you go along this path with me.</p>
