I"ò<p>How to get a foot into the door of supply chain management? That was the question I asked myself several times while doing multiple online courses on the subject. The optimization topics were nice, the mathematics often quite involved (which I loved!) but in the end it remained theoretical since most companies were made up, some routings mathematically impossible and the network component often not included in the models.
Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.scmglobe.com/">SCM Globe</a> while looking for SCM case studies and had the time of my life. (This is not sponsored, I just enjoyed it very much). This gave me actually a possibility to develop a SCM case study portfolio while showing of my data analytics skills. This series is meant to show off my portfolio and help others to follow this path.</p>

<p>So, what is SCM Globe and what can we do with it? Starting with the disclaimer that it is not free seems to be necessary at this point. But you can get (for the time being) a free version depending on your status. 
In my opinion it is very intuitive to handle but the getting started videos also add a lot of value especially when you think about getting a trial version. My recommendation: Watch all the getting started videos beforehand to jump right into the good stuff as soon as your trial starts. In the end it is a very simplistic and rapidely explained UI but with nice modelling possibilities.</p>
